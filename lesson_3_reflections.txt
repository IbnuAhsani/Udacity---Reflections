When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-)When you a working on a group project, it would be much simpler if all the team members had direct access to the different files that are going to be used by each of the team members continously.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-)Because the user knows best, if changes have been made to a file but those changes are not final, if github automatically pushes those changes, then the change that have been made might not be the changes that user intended it to be.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-) Branches: Different branch within a file in your local repository that you can create
Clones: Copy pasting a repository from Github to your local repository
Forks: Copy pasting a repository from one Github account to another.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-)So that if you want to continue your work ofline, you could do so without cloning the latest commit that was stored in Github

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

-)I would collaborate using Github if i had to do a project with multiple people, cuz it would simply the coding process and make everything more efficient.
